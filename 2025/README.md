## C (without a standard library)

This year is going to use C, but without any help from any sort of libc. I'm on linux on x86_64, so this will be platform dependant. I will not support other platforms or operating systems, since this is just to solve problems.

Over the questions, as I need more and more tools, I will slowly build up some sort of libc. I will try to follow the same structure that libc provides (stdio.h, stdlib.h, etc. etc.), but I will probably not fully develop a fully working standard library. If malloc is never needed, it probably won't be implemented.

My goal is to hopefully finish this year. I don't really care for placement, only really completion. It would be cool to have 50/50 completions with code that only I wrote. No hidden code behind the scenes (besides compiler shenanigans, that might be a future year's attempt), no library no make my life easier. If I want something to happen, I have to tell the computer exactly what I want (mostly).
